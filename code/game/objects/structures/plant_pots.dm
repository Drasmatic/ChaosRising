- to-do wishlist: 1.get some code to replace corpse flower & pitcher plant with realised potted plants that do the real thing against flies, mosquitos, mice and insects
- 2.exotic realised plants might need some exclusive resource from jungle biomes or where appropriate
- 3.potted plant climatization on continents, generalised on general maps
- potted plant climatization cont: allowed under a glass roof or something detrimental will happen to it to encourage greenhouses/exhibitions.
- 4. potted plant harvests for chinchona, greenhousing (see point 3)
- 5. A soil variant the previous points will rely upon closer to ye olde farming
- 6.bees
- bees cont: can react to potted plants if more realisation is brought in as a substitute to natural wild.dm structures
